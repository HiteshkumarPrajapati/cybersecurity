# OzCazual Cybersecurity Infrastructure Modernisation

OzCazual is a growing online clothing retailer that experienced increased cyber risk due to insecure legacy infrastructure, 
remote workforce expansion, and outdated security controls. 
This project redesigns OzCazual’s IT environment using **security-by-design, defense-in-depth**, and industry best practices, 
aligned with **NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST SP 800-53, and OWASP Top 10.**
